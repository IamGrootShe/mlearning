An introduction to the Hive Metastore Catalog in Databricks, explaining concepts like managed tables, external tables, and views. 
It highlights the differences between managed and external tables, particularly concerning data persistence after dropping a table.

Here are the key takeaways:

Hive Metastore Catalog:

Before Unity Catalog, Hive Metastore was the default catalog in Databricks for storing structured data assets.
It comes with a default schema. If no schema is specified during table creation, the table is created under the default schema.
To use the Hive Metastore, a compute resource (like a serverless warehouse or cluster) is required.

Managed Table:

In a managed table, both metadata (schema) and data are managed by the Metastore.
When a managed table is dropped, both the metadata and the data are permanently deleted.
The default location for data stored in a managed table in Hive Metastore is DBFS (Databricks File System) within the managed resource group.
Managed tables in Databricks are Delta tables by default.

External Table:

Unlike managed tables, for external tables, only the metadata is managed by the Metastore, while the data is stored at a user-defined external location.
When an external table is dropped, only the metadata is removed, and the underlying data remains intact at its specified location. This allows for re-creation of the table using the existing data.

Views:

Views can be created in the Hive Metastore.
They are permanent, meaning they persist even if the cluster is terminated and restarted.
Views are essentially stored queries that retrieve data from underlying tables.
